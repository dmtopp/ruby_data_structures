Some quick implementations of data structures in ruby

_______


_This project is unfinished, some classes may not be functional_

This was done for my own educational purposes.  Each class is separated into its own ruby file, and my mess of code to make sure everything works correctly is in test.rb.  The implementations are based off of [Brian Will's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOfhwxirhUE&t=640s).  I have tried to go a little bit above and beyond and implement some of the methods he left out in the video.

For the purposes of these exercises, I'm pretending that the ruby definition of an array is the 'classical' definition with fixed length.
